gf3 is a free drawing program that uses GTK+.

IT ISN"T READY FOR USE!

IT'S NOT EVEN ALPHA LEVEL YET!

IT /WILL/ BLOW UP YOUR COMPUTER!

I ONLY PUT IT ON GITHUB AS YET ANOTHER BACKUP.




Eventually, in addition to all the usual stuff like drawing lines, circles/ellipses,
text, etc, it will allow the user to create a tree hierarchy of drawings that can be 
used, for example, to create details.

gf3 has the usual point-and-click interface, but also supports a command-line i/f that
lets the user specify entities with constructs like:

gf_spw(1.5)

dd0 = gf_ellcabt_t (5, 8, 1,    2, gf_deg(-45), filled=0)
dd1 = gf_ellcabt_t (5, 8, 1.3, 2, gf_deg(-45), filled=0)
dd2 = gf_ellcabt_t (5, 8, 1.6, 2, gf_deg(-45), filled=0)

gf_draw (dd0, dd1, dd2, tf = gf_scale_t (1.6, 1.6))

gr = gf_group_t (dd0, dd1, dd2, centre = gf_point_t (5, 8))
gf_draw (gr)

These operations are all interpreted by embedded/extended Python, so you can do 
things like:

c0 = gf_circle_t(3, 4, 3)
c1 = gf_circle_t(1, 3, 3)
i0 = gf_intersect(c0, c1)
if (len (i0) >= 2) :
  l0=gf_line_t(i0)
  o0 = (c0, c1, l0)
else:
  o0 = (c0, c1)
gf_draw(o0)

where the target assignments can be primitives like circles or more abstract things 
like, in this case, an array of the intersections of a couple of circles.

Of course, all the normal Python constructs are available, like:

for x in range(0, 3):
  gfig.Circle(x,2,1)
